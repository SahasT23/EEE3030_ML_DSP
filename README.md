# EEE3030 Project and Lab Repo

This repository contains the code, reports and documentation needed for a user to understand the basics of digital signal processing using MATLAB and Python.

### Contents

1. Semester 1 Labs -- labelled as ```EEE3030_S1_Labs``` - contains the lab exercises and solutions for each lab session along with extra experiments based on **Digital Signal Processing**.
2. Semester 2 Labs -- labelled as ```EEE3030_S1_Labs``` - contains lab exercises and solutions for each lab session and includes notes on **Machine Learning Methods**, covering **Linear** and **Logistic Regression**.
3. Assignments -- These are hidden files that you (yes, YOU) cannot see, covering the coursework aspect of this module.

## Usage

Read the MATLAB/Python code and see what you can understand. DO NOT COPY, try it yourself. 

# TODO

1. Need to build and use DSP library, verify toml file actually works instead of using setup.py
2. Go through and write solutions for Exercises in both matlab and python. (Needs to be done by 17th October).

## Queries and Contact

Documentation for the custom library that I am using will be linked here:
